## Usage Guidelines

### Primary Color Usage

- **Purple (#6B46C1)** and **Orange (#F97316)** are the hero colors of our brand
- Use Purple for primary brand elements, navigation, and key interactive components
- Use Orange sparingly for calls-to-action, important alerts, and elements requiring immediate attention
- Black and White serve as neutral foundations supporting the primary colors

### Secondary Color Usage

- Secondary colors should complement, not compete with, primary colors
- Use lighter shades (Lavender, Lilac, Orchid) for backgrounds and large areas
- Use darker shades (Iris, Violet, Indigo, Plum, Grape) for accents and emphasis
- Maintain hierarchy by using secondary colors for supporting elements only

### Grayscale Usage

- Use grayscale colors for text, borders, backgrounds, and UI elements
- Lighter greys (Mist, Dove, Steel) work well for backgrounds and subtle divisions
- Medium greys (Glacier, Slate) are ideal for secondary text and inactive states
- Darker greys (Iron, Shadow) provide strong contrast for important text

### Color Combinations

**Recommended Pairings:**

- Purple (#6B46C1) with White (#FFFFFF)
- Orange (#F97316) with Black (#000000)
- Lavender (#E6E6FA) with Purple (#6B46C1)
- Orchid (#DA70D6) with White (#FFFFFF)
- Grayscale colors with any primary or secondary color

**Avoid:**

- Orange on purple backgrounds (poor contrast)
- Multiple secondary colors competing in the same design
- Dark secondary colors on black backgrounds

## Accessibility Considerations

### Contrast Ratios

Ensure all text and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

- **Normal text:** Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1
- **Large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold):** Minimum contrast ratio of 3:1
- **UI components and graphics:** Minimum contrast ratio of 3:1

### Accessible Color Pairings

**High Contrast Pairs (AAA compliant):**

- Black (#000000) on White (#FFFFFF)
- White (#FFFFFF) on Purple (#6B46C1)
- White (#FFFFFF) on Iris (#5D3FD3)
- White (#FFFFFF) on Violet (#8A2BE2)
- White (#FFFFFF) on Indigo (#4B0082)

- Black (#000000) on Lilac (#C8A2C8)
- Shadow (#4D4D4D) on White (#FFFFFF)
- Iron (#666666) on White (#FFFFFF)

### Color Blindness Considerations

- Never rely on color alone to convey information

- Test designs with color blindness simulators
- Purple and Orange combination works well for most types of color blindness
